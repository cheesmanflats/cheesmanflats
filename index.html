    <h2>Exemption Compliance with House Bill 23-1099:</h2>
    <h3>Application Fee and PTSR Policies</h3>
    <p>
      In accordance with House Bill 23-1099, Cheesman Flats and the landlords we represent are exempt from the
      requirements of subsections (1.5)(a)-(1.5)(e) of Colorado Revised Statutes, Section 38-12-904 (1.5). This exemption
      applies because we charge only one application fee for applicants who will be cohabitating and refund this fee if
      the lease is not signed. Therefore, we are not required to accept Portable Tenant Screening Reports (PTSR) from
      prospective tenants, as per the exemption criteria outlined in subsection (1.5)(f).
